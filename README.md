# Team Project repo

[![Checks](https://github.com/gcivil-nyu-org/team-5-fall26/actions/workflows/checks.yml/badge.svg?event=pull_request)](https://github.com/gcivil-nyu-org/team-5-fall26/actions/workflows/checks.yml?query=event%3Apull_request)

## Local development

Requires Python 3.11 or newer and Docker with Docker Compose. Start Docker
before running these commands.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cp .env.example .env  # Windows: copy .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --wait db
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

The project uses PostgreSQL 17 locally. Django loads database settings from
`.env`; exported environment variables take precedence. The example credentials
are for local development. Set `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`,
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_HOST`, and `POSTGRES_PORT` to use an existing
PostgreSQL server instead of Docker. Django 5.2 supports PostgreSQL 14 or newer
with the [Psycopg 3 driver](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/databases/#postgresql-notes).

The Compose database stores data in a persistent Docker volume. Stop it with
`docker compose stop db` and start it again with `docker compose up -d --wait db`.
Changing the database name, user, or password in `.env` does not update an
already initialized volume; update the existing database to match.

The sign-up page is at http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/register/ and the login
page is at http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/.

In development, emails such as password reset links aren't actually sent;
they're printed in the terminal running `runserver`.

## NYC Parks events

The landing page lists upcoming NYC Parks events imported from the city's
[open data feed](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/v3/views/w3wp-dpdi).
Sync the database from the feed with:

```bash
python manage.py sync_events
```

The command fetches every record, creates new events, updates events whose
content changed, leaves unchanged events untouched, and marks events done
once their end time has passed. The feed only publishes a rolling two-week
window, but events stay in the database after they disappear from it.

Run it once to seed your local database.

## Cron job (hourly sync)

The sync is **not automatic yet** — register it once per machine:

```bash
crontab -e
# add this line (absolute paths only; cron has no repo dir and no venv on PATH):
0 * * * * cd /path/to/team-5-fall26 && /path/to/.venv/bin/python manage.py sync_events >> /var/log/team5_sync.log 2>&1
```

- Runs every hour at :00; each run prints a summary to the log file.
- On failure (feed down, bad payload) exits non-zero and leaves the database untouched.
- **WSL**: cron is off by default — `sudo service cron start`, then `sudo systemctl enable cron`.
- Windows: use Task Scheduler instead — `schtasks /sc hourly /tn "Team5EventsSync" /tr "C:\path\to\python manage.py sync_events"`.

## Checks

The badge above shows the combined status of the Black, Flake8, and coverage jobs
in the pull request workflow. Click it to see workflow runs and individual job
results.

Start PostgreSQL with `docker compose up -d --wait db` before running tests.
The database user needs permission to create Django's temporary test database;
the Compose and CI users already have it. CI runs tests against PostgreSQL 17.

Run these before opening a pull request:

```bash
black --check .
flake8
coverage run manage.py test
coverage report  # fails below 95% coverage
```
